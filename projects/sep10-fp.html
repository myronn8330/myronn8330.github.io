                <li>Context: During the expo elevator pitch, I was presenting to the judges who were passing by, and they pointed out that my navbar blends in with my website, rendering it unreadable on mobile devices. So I later determined how to alter my navbar a new color in order to improve my website. For me, the in-class presentation was hampered by my inability to maintain eye contact with my classmates, and it was mostly focused on Mr. Mueller. The conclusion was not succinctly stated.
                    </li>
                <li>
                Skill: As someone who procrastinates a lot, I was able to finish my slides a few days before the deadline, and I assisted with the last few slides and laid out the flow of the presentation. Working with Jennifer has really enhanced my teamwork abilities. I became used to working with folks that were a little difficult to deal with. The capacity to adjust to and work effectively with classmates will be beneficial to me in the future.

                EDP:As I continue to refine my concept, there are several possibilities. SHADE might be expanded into a variety of marketing fields. It may be utilized for a variety of different businesses that make investments to increase my income. This initiative will be the world's future leader in secure communication.
